# How To use the Script

<h4>Open the terminal and add the following: </h4>
<br />
```bash git clone https://github.com/HatemSaadallah/script-to-install-packages-pgf.git ```
<p> <ul> <li>```git clone https://github.com/HatemSaadallah/script-to-install-packages-pgf.git```</li> <li>`cd script-to-install-packages-pgf`
  </li> <li>`./runScript.sh`</li></ul> </p>

<p>The script will begin running, it might ask for the root password, enter it, and let the magic do its work</p>

<h6>NOTE: The computer will reboot after the script finishes, so make sure that you have your work saved before running it</h6>
